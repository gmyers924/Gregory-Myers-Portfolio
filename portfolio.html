                                <li><strong>Date Created:</strong> October 20th, 2024 </li>
                                <li><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Amazon Polly (Text-Speech), Bootstrap, Laravel, CSS3, HTML5, PHP, XAMPP, JavaScript, Visual Studio, Google Maps (Embedded Map), Microsoft Word</li>
                                <li><strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong> Web Development, Community Integration, Audio/Video Implementation, JavaScript Interactivity, Bootstrap Design, Backend Development, Google Maps Customization</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Development Details:</strong> For this project, I aimed to create a comprehensive website focused on mental health awareness and community engagement. Using Laravel as the foundation, I incorporated multiple 
                                features designed to improve functionality and user experience. I developed interactive JavaScript buttons, such as a dynamic toggle icon for the audio text-to-speech feature, and built a multi-page structure with 
                                breadcrumbs, dropdown navigation, and a hero image. Leveraging Bootstrap, I implemented an accordion-style FAQ section to provide answers to common mental health questions.<br />

                                Additionally, I created a contact form that confirms successful submissions, integrated a login and registration system for the community page, and added embedded video and audio content. I also designed a Google Map 
                                with custom data relevant to mental health resources, which was embedded into the site. <br />
                                
                                Some challenges I faced included organizing all the files correctly into directories, troubleshooting the JavaScript functionality for the audio toggle button, and mastering the Bootstrap accordion menu. However, 
                                I stayed persistent, researched extensively, and tested thoroughly until these components were functioning seamlessly.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Development Details:</strong> I developed an engaging and informative site using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. To enhance user experience, I incorporated my own videos where I learned sign language, used icons to help with 
                            symbols, added pagination for easy navigation, and included text-to-speech features to aid in accessibility. One of the significant challenges was learning sign language enough to create accurate content and integrating the search 
                            bar functionality along with specific icons from the Bootstrap library.</p>
                            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Sign language bridges the gap, allowing individuals to use their hands to create symbols and signs for effective communication. It has been around for ages and excels at conveying messages to those 
                            who are deaf or hard of hearing. But it’s not just for them—it’s a powerful tool for everyone. Whether you need to stay silent or want to connect more broadly, sign language is invaluable.</p>
                            <p><strong>Reason for Selection:</strong> This project stands out for its creative use of media and my personal journey in learning sign language. It's one of my favorite projects because it not only challenged me technically but

                            <p><strong>Development Details:</strong> I developed an inventory application using Laravel in Visual Studio, utilizing MySQL, XML, PHP, HTML, and Bootstrap. Data was connected and stored in a MySQL Workbench database. The biggest 
                            challenge was getting it to run with XAMPP. MySQL kept failing to run, despite being downloaded. Through Task Manager, I discovered another application was running MySQL, preventing it from starting in XAMPP. Another issue was with 
                            the file directory; I initially placed the files incorrectly and needed to separate the Blade files into a different folder, the items folder.</p>

                            <p><strong>Reason for Selection:</strong> This project demonstrated my mastery in Laravel and showed my ability to create forms. I chose this project because I was proud of how the form turned out and the skills I developed.
